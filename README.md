The Back Propagation Algorithm in C++
==========================

A implementation of the back propagation algorithm in c++. The implementation is based on a blog post [1] by James McCaffrey.

[1] Neural Network Back-Propagation for Programmers: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj658979.aspx

This implementtation is a *bit* different from the implementation in the original blog post.

(1) separates the bp algorithm from the network structure;
(2) separates the activation function from the bp algorithm;
