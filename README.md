The Back Propagation Algorithm in C++
==========================

A implementation of the back propagation algorithm in c++. The implementation is based on a blog post [1] by James McCaffrey. In order to make this code more scalable, I made several changes:

(1) separates the bp algorithm from the network structure;
(2) separates the activation function from the bp algorithm;
