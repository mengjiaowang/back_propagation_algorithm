The Back Propagation Algorithm in C++
==========================

A implementation of the back propagation algorithm in c++. The implementation is based on a blog post [1] by James McCaffrey. In order to make this code more scalable, I made several changes:

(1) separate the bp algorithm from the network structure.
(2) separate the activation function from the bp algorithm.
(3) add normalization method for traning and testing data.
